![Google Summer Of Code 2016][1]
</div>

“GSoC 2016: Congratulations, your proposal with Debian Project has been accepted!”, this was the title of the email I received confirming my admission to the Google Summer Of Code program this summer (2016). [Link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5306001582456832)

I'm really excited about this especially because this is my first big step into FOSS world as a developer.

The organization I will be collaborating with is Debian. The goal of my project is to have the entire Android toolchain and SDK in Debian ! You can check more details about the project [here](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2016/Projects#SummerOfCode2016.2FProjects.2FAndroidSDKToolsInDebian.Android_SDK_Tools_in_Debian).

The First step of GSOC is the “Community Bonding” period, therefore, I had the pleasure to meet my mentors and colleagues that I will collaborate with during the next “Coding Period”, which starts from May 23rd to August 23rd, 2016 !
