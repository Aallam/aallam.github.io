## The problem

In Java, a program code can change a lot between its Java source code form, Byte code form, and machine code form. The
Java source code focuses more on _readability and clarity_, while the machine code focuses on _performance and
efficiency_. The JVM is allowed to optimize the code, with different degrees of optimization (depending on the
compilation stage), as long as it remains correct. But, this task can be handy in the context of multi-threaded
applications.

### Sequential consistency

There are multiple levels of caching while executing a program; the processor never operates on values directly in the
main memory, but instead, it loads the values to its cache, manipulates them, then writes them back to the main memory.
Let's take the following example:

```java
class Reorder {
    int foo = 0;
    int bar = 0;

    void calc() {
        foo += 1; //#1
        bar += 1; //#2
        foo += 2; //#3
    }
}
```

How the processor can execute the method `calc()` in memory?

1. Load `foo` from main memory to processor cache. Increment by 1, write it back the main memory (`#1`).
2. Load `bar` from main memory to processor cache. Increment by 1, write it back the main memory (`#2`).
3. Load `foo` from main memory to processor cache. Increment by 2, write it back the main memory (`#3`).

How the earlier example can be optimized ? by swiping the instructions (`#2` and `#3`):

```java
void calc() {
    foo+=1; //#1
    foo+=2; //#3
    bar+=1; //#2
}
```

1. Load `foo` from main memory to processor cache. Increment by 1, Increment by 2, write it back the main memory (`#1`
   and `#3`).
2. Load `bar` from main memory to processor cache. Increment by 1, write it back the main memory (`#2`).

In a single-threaded program, this optimization can be considered without side effects, however, in a multi-threaded
world, it introduces some abnormal behavior:

The possible values of the variables overtime in the two cases shows the slight difference:

* Before optimisation:
    1. (foo == 0, bar == 0)
    2. (foo == 1, bar == 0)
    3. **(foo == 1, bar == 1)**
    4. (foo == 3, bar == 1)

* After optimisation:
    1. (foo == 0, bar == 0)
    2. (foo == 1, bar == 0)
    3. **(foo == 3, bar == 0)**
    4. (foo == 3, bar == 1)

This previous example is an optimization that the JVM is allowed to do. The JVM can do much more complex optimizations,
however, the outcome might be unexpected in a multi-threaded world! But why optimize then? The answer: *memory access
latency*!

</div>

### Eventual consistency

A machine can have multiprocessors, and (at some level) each processor has its cache, which means, each processor loads
only the values it needs for its operations.  
Lets we have two processors and the following program:

```java
class Caching {
    boolean flag = true;
    int count = 0;

    void thread1() {
        while (flag) count++;
    }

    void thread2() {
        flag = false;
    }
} 
```

Let's say processor `#1` will run the method `thread1()` and processor `#2` will run the method `thread2()`. An
optimization can be the following:

* Since `thread1()` never modifies the `flag` variable, there is no need to load it from the main memory for each loop
  check, only once to the cache is enough -> the changes to `flag` might never be observed!
* Processor `#2` has no obligation to write it changes to the `flag` variable to the main memory! This means an
  optimization can be to simply not do the operation at all!

### 1.3 Atomicity

The atomicity in Java is to consider all values are atomic, which means that the modification to a variable (for example
64 bit types like `long`  and `double`) to be done atomically.

Let's consider the following example:

```java
class LongTearing {
    long foo = 0L;

    void thread1() {
        foo = 0x0000FFFF; // 2147483647 
    }

    void thread2() {
        foo = 0xFFFF0000; // -2147483648 
    }
} 
```

A 64 bit `long` variable, is written in two slots in the case of 32 memory, a problem can occur here:

* `thread1()` writes the _first half_ of its value to memory `0000`.
* `thread2()` writes the _second half_ of its value to memory `0000`.
* `thread1()` writes the _second half_ of its value to memory `FFFF`.
* `thread1()` writes the _first half_ of its value to memory `FFFF`.
* The final value of the variable will be then: `0xFFFFFFFF` !!!

### Processor optimization

Ordering operations sometimes are tied to the processor architecture. Optimization needs can be different for example
between ARM processors and x86 processors. ARM processors can be more aggressive because they are designed for
energy-consuming efficiency, than x86 processors which are more about calculation speed.

## What is the Java memory model?

Java memory model answers the question: what values can be observed upon reading from a specific field?

Formally specified by breaking down a Java program into **actions** and applying several **orderings** to these actions.
If one can derive a so-called **happens-before** ordering between **write actions**, and a **read actions** of one
field, the Java memory model guarantees that the read returns a particular value.

The Java memory machine guarantees _intra-thread consistency_ equivalent to sequential consistency.

### Building blocks

According to the Java memory model, using the following keywords, a programmer can indicate to the JVM to _refrain from
optimizations_ that could otherwise cause concurrency issues:

* Field-scoped: `final`, `volatile`.
* Method-scoped: `synchronized` (method/block), `java.util.concurrent .*`.

In terms of the Java memory model, the above concepts introduce additional **synchronization actions** which introduce
additional (partial) **orders**. Without such modifiers, reads and writes might not be ordered what results in a data
race.  
A memory model is a **trade-off** between a language’s simplicity (consistency/atomicity) and its performance.

### Volatile

Lets take the following example:

```java
class DataRace {
    boolean ready = false;
    int answer = 0;

    void thread1() {
        while (!ready) ;
        assert answer == 42;
    }

    void thread2() {
        answer = 42;   // #1
        ready = true;  // #2
    }
} 
```

The lines `#1` and `#2` can be reordered! This means, the assertion in method `thread1()` can fail in a multi-threaded
world!  
A solution ? The keyword `volatile`:

```java
class DataRace {
    volatile boolean ready = false;
    int answer = 0;

    void thread1() {
        while (!ready) ;
        assert answer == 42;
    }

    void thread2() {
        answer = 42;   // #1
        ready = true;  // #2
    }
} 
```

`volatile` implies for two threads with a write-read relationship on the _*same field*_, certain optimizations are not
allowed!

<div class="text-center" markdown="1">
![Volatile Synchronization][2]
</div>

1. When a thread *writes* to a `volatile` variable, all of its previous writes are _guaranteed_ to be visible to another
   thread when that thread is reading the same value.
2. Both threads _must align_ “their” `volatile` value with that _in main memory_ (flush).
3. If the `volatile` value was a `long` or a `double` value, *word-tearing* was _forbidden_.

### Synchronized

Another way to achieve the synchronization is by using: `synchronized`
Lets check the following example assuming the second thread acquires the lock first:

```java
class DataRace {
    boolean ready = false;
    int answer = 0;

    synchronized void thread1() {
        while (!ready) ;
        assert answer == 42;
    }

    synchronized void thread2() { //Assuming this is called 1st
        answer = 42;
        ready = true;
    }
} 
```

When a thread *releases* a monitor, all of its previous writes are _guaranteed_ to be visible to another thread after
that thread is _locking the same monitor._. This only applies for two threads with an _*unlock-lock relationship*_ on
the same monitor!
<div class="text-center" markdown="1">
![Synchronized Synchronization][3]
</div>

### Thread life-cycle semantics

When a thread starts another thread, the started thread is guaranteed to see all values that were set by the starting
thread.

```java
class ThreadLifeCycle {
    int foo = 0;

    void method() {
        foo = 42;
        new Thread() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                assert foo == 42;
            }
        }.start();
    }
} 
```

<div class="text-center" markdown="1">
![Thread Life-cycle][4]
</div>
Similarly, a thread that joins another thread is guaranteed to see all values that were set by the joined thread. 

### Final field semantics

When a thread creates an instance, the instance’s `final` fields are *frozen*. The Java memory model requires a field’s
initial value to be visible in the initialized form to other threads.
<div class="text-center" markdown="1">
![Final Synchronization][5]
</div>
This requirement also holds for properties that are dereferenced via a `final` field, even if the field value’s properties are not final themselves (memory-chain order). 

### External actions

A JIT-compiler _cannot_ determine the side-effects of a *native* operation. Therefore, external actions are _guaranteed_
to _not be reordered_.

```java
class Externalization {
    int foo = 0;

    void method() {
        foo = 42;
        jni(); // Not re-ordered
    }

    native void jni();
} 
```

External actions include JNI, socket communication, file system operations, or interaction with the console (
non-exclusive list).

### Thread-divergence actions

Thread-divergence actions are _guaranteed to not be reordered_. This prevents surprising outcomes of actions that might
never be reached.

```java
class ThreadDivergence {
    int foo = 42;

    void thread1() {
        while (true) ;
        foo = 0; // Not re-ordered
    }

    void thread2() {
        assert foo == 42;
    }
} 
```

In the previous example, in the method `thread1()` the line `foo = 0` is unreachable. Thus not re-ordered.

## In Practice

The following are some practical examples of Java Memory Model use (or misuse).

### Double-checking

The following is a lazy instance creation example:

```java
class DoubleChecked {
    static volatile DoubleChecked instance;

    static DoubleChecked getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (DoubleChecked.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new DoubleChecked();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }

    int foo;

    DoubleChecked() {
        foo = 42;
    }

    void method() {
        assert foo == 42;
    }
} 
```

This example works because of `volatile`, omitting it may cause having an instance of an object created, but
uninitialized!

### Arrays

Declaring an array to be `volatile` _does not_ make its elements `volatile`! In the following example, there is no
write-read edge because the array is only read by any thread:

```java
class DataRace {
    volatile boolean[] ready = new boolean[]{false};
    int answer = 0;

    void thread1() {
        while (!ready[0]) ;
        assert answer == 42;
    }

    void thread2() {
        answer = 42;
        ready[0] = true;
    }
} 
```

For such volatile element access: `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicIntegerArray`.
